# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:

- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**

- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**

- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence**
   - Log what data enters the system
   - Log what data exits
   - Verify state at each layer
   - Find WHERE it breaks

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - See where bad value originates
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - Read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - MUST have before fixing

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question architecture**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed**
   - Pattern indicating architectural problem
   - Each fix reveals new issue in different place
   - Discuss with your team before more fixes
   - This is NOT a failed hypothesis - wrong architecture

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking:

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse                                  | Reality                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Issue is simple, don't need process"   | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast.   |
| "Emergency, no time for process"        | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check.   |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from start.    |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time"     | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs.            |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+)       | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase                 | Key Activities                                         | Success Criteria            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **1. Investigation**  | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY     |
| **2. Pattern**        | Find working examples, compare                         | Identify differences        |
| **3. Hypothesis**     | Form theory, test minimally                            | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify                               | Bug resolved, tests pass    |

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:

- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common
